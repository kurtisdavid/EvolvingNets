**Edit: You can now view it using Nbviewer here:**

https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/kurtisdavid/EvolvingNets/blob/master/Final%20Report/Report/FR_KurtisDavid.ipynb

If you want to have it locally follow these steps:

This folder contains all the files of my final report. To get started, Jupyter Notebook must be installed.

To install, run:

```
$ pip install jupyter
```

Now, in terminal:

```
$ jupyter notebook
```

After running this command, Jupyter Notebook should open, and navigate to FR_KurtisDavid.ipynb (after downloading with all the images/files).
